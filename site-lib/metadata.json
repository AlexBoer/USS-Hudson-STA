From a reddit post <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/startrekadventures/comments/hsl9nh/a_setting_overview_for_2380/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/startrekadventures/comments/hsl9nh/a_setting_overview_for_2380/\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.\nThe adventure starts in the year 2385, seven years after the USS Voyager returned to Earth, and ten years after the conclusion of the Dominion War. The Alpha and Beta Quadrants are in an uneasy but stable peace.The Romulans are more wary and less arrogant in regard to the Federation. They have somehow become aware of actions Section 31 took to end the Dominion War, and contrary to the horror Federation leadership had when they learned of it, the Romulans seem to have taken it as a sign that they have gravely underestimated the Federation.From their perspective, the Federation encountered a civilization that attempted to subvert them and subjugate them in the Dominion, and instead of taking the expected actions by conceding everything one piece at a time until it was all lost, the Federation prompted direct confrontation by mining the wormhole and actively attacking their opponent’s logistical support.Once the war had begun, the Federation was able to somehow not only convince the Klingons to fight at their side, but to do so at the direction of Starfleet, which the Romulan government found to be a totally incredulous idea. A Starfleet captain had orchestrated the assassination of a Romulan Senator in order to manipulate them into fighting at the Federation’s side as well! Finally, the Federation showed a willingness to engage in total war when existentially threatened.Then: the Hobus supernova. The efforts of Spock and the Federation do little to ease the sting Romulans feel. The Federation took the lead in the evacuation of Romulus and the surrounding systems. But then, when the need for help was most dire, abandoned them. Worse, the Federation has showed that they have internal issues that can Limited trade, and the continuation of the Neutral Zone as well as the Treaty of Algeron, will maintain the status quo while the Romulans put in effort to modernize and update their fleet and empire.The Klingons have become much closer to the Federation since the victory over the Cardassians and the Dominion. Many within the Houses have suggested that the consistency of honor in battle by Starfleet is a sign of a worthy ally, and that the empire should seek to continue the friendly relationship it now has with Starfleet and the Federation.This is at odds with the renewed thirst for battle that Klingon society is experiencing, however it is obvious now that the Federation would make terrible enemies if direct conflict happened, and it is unlikely that the Federation would stand by should the Klingon Empire seek to expand once again, even if it wasn’t near the Federation.Klingon society also depends heavily at this point on dilithium imports from the Federation, and their society has become far too economically tied to the Federation for open conflict to be anything except painful.Some Klingons suggest that in primarily exploring, the average Starfleet vessel encounters more battle than the average Klingon vessel does. Because of this, there is a growing sentiment that a Klingon who joins Starfleet has a better chance of finding glory than a Klingon who serves the empire. Some have even suggested that the empire should join the Federation and find glory in defending it against the many foes it has, some of which are quite formidable such as the Borg.This sentiment is not yet widespread, and though it is talked about by many Klingons, it is always in hushed voices. There have been many more Klingons who have joined Starfleet however, and while some were unable to make it in an environment where they needed to respect and follow the orders of non-Klingon superiors, others have found their lives to be much better and more fulfilling.There is also the risk of the thirst for battle being turned inward. Without a good path to conquer other societies, and with the conflict in opinion about the Federation, the stability of the Klingon Empire is threatened, and it is possible that a civil war may break out over cooperation with the Federation. This would be just as much due to their thirst for battle having no viable outlet as it would be to the disagreement itself.Utterly ruined by the war, Cardassian society totally collapsed due to the conflict. During the post-war occupation by the Federation, Klingons, and Romulans, Cardassian society was transformed. The common Cardassian was opened to the idea that while their loyalty had always been to the state, the state’s loyalty hadn’t always been to them.The catastrophic loss of life left the people open to new ideas, and during the four years of occupation and rebuilding (which ended officially in 2379), Bajoran society was perhaps ironically a huge influence on Cardassia.Cardassians now have a nascent society which values the art and culture of their people. They are all aware of just how close their society and culture came to extermination at the hands of either the Dominion or the Alliance forces, and there is an existential need among Cardassians to show that their culture is one worth preserving. That it is better for everyone that they didn’t die to the last man.The Detapa Council has been remade, but in a move that would have been unthinkable only a decade ago, most of its members are now elected by the people. In addition to the elected members, the council has two members that are elected by members of the military, one member who is elected by members of the remade Obsidian order, and one more member who is elected by Cardassians which live outside of Cardassian territory. This, combined with the five members elected by the Cardassian public, make up the nine people who make up the council.A large number of Cardassians which live outside of Cardassian territory live on Bajor, which is to some ironic. However, it is obvious to even the most proud Cardassian how much of their survival is due to the efforts of a Bajoran freedom fighter, Kira Nerys.One of the first actions taken by the reformed Detapa Council was to make a formal apology to the people of Bajor, and a promise of reparations once Cardassian society was capable. This might have been received quite coldly, except for the words of Kira. She argued to the Council of Ministers that the Cardassian people, and Cardassian society, had received their punishment already.Her testimony of the ways in which Cardassians had suffered, and the extent of the suffering, swayed not only the Ministers, but much of Bajoran society. Many began to view the Cardassian people not as evil, but as being victims of their out-of-control military almost as much as the Bajorans had been, an analogy that Kira herself made.Because of this, the apology was accepted, but the offer of reparations was officially rejected by the Bajoran government. Their response was that any help such reparations might have provided to Bajor had already been taken care of by the Federation, and that instead the Bajorans would help the Federation in doing the same for Cardassian culture.Such help from a people that many Cardassians were aware of having suffered so brutally at their hands, a people that were not Cardassian, was one of the turning points in the rebuilding of Cardassian society.Today, Cardassia and Bajor are each the second largest populations of their respective species outside of their homeworlds, and there is extensive trade between the two. Many Cardassians have become fascinated by the Bajoran religion of the Prophets, and many Bajorans have become fascinated by the talent for art that many Cardassians have, especially when most Bajorans grew up believing that the only talent Cardassians had was brutality.Near the end of the occupation period, when Bajor was admitted to the Federation, some Cardassians began to suggest that Cardassia should also ask to join the Federation. The argument was that the Federation was already there rebuilding their society, and perhaps the way forward was the Federation to simply not leave.While this idea was considered more warily by some Cardassians, very few were vehemently opposed to it. Even so, Cardassian leadership, Bajoran advisors, and the Federation itself all argued against it.Cardassian leadership argued that the Cardassian people hadn’t ever really had the chance to figure out who they were as a people, and they needed to do this before such a thing could be considered.Bajoran leadership argued that the Cardassian people were in the same situation the Bajorans had been, and that it was important that they saw themselves stand on their own feet before making such a decision. They said that they understood and sympathized with the idea, because many on Bajor had felt the same way when the Cardassians had left and the Federation had stepped in. But they said that now they see how valuable it had been to stand on their own for a while first.The Federation argued that while they would be happy to provide whatever humanitarian assistance was necessary, there were simply too many fresh wounds that needed time to heal. The Federation Council privately told the Cardassian leadership that it was unlikely the Cardassian people would be given a fair consideration be some of its members if the request was made so soon, and that further, some members of the Federation would feel it was too much like conquering and annexing Cardassia.Cardassian society now finds itself in a stable if somewhat raw state, ready to venture out with new perspective for the first time since becoming warp capable.The final efforts of the Voyager crew with regard to the Borg are highly classified. What is commonly understood among the rank-and-file is that the Borg were dealt a severe blow, and that the Federation considers any incursion by the Borg for the foreseeable future to be unlikely.Even so, Starfleet crews and ships are still designed and trained with conflict with the Borg in mind, and though the details are known to only a select few, it is apparent to many within Starfleet that the technologies to deal with the Borg are still in active development.The status of Seven of Nine, and her existence is now widely known throughout all of the Federation, and consequently throughout the quadrant. However, whether because she has been instructed not to or because she does not wish to, she has never publicly commented on the Borg or her experiences with them.Only two further contacts with the Dominion have been made since the end of the war and the return of Odo to The Great Link. The first contact came in 2375 only weeks after the war had ended and was a more formal accounting of the parameters of surrender the Federation was imposing on the Dominion. These included prohibiting any Dominion forces from entering the Alpha Quadrant by any means, and the requirement for any Changelings who enter the Alpha Quadrant to stop at Deep Space Nine to notify the Federation of their intended destination and purpose.As an enforcement measure, the Federation imposed a mandatory search for Changelings of any vessel returning through the wormhole for at least the next 10 years. This extraordinary measure would not normally have been palatable to the Federation, but the war had been so vast and so destructive that not only Federation citizens, but even the Klingons and Romulans saw the wisdom of allowing the Federation to search all vessels returning from the Gamma Quadrant.Since neither the Romulans nor the Klingons trusted each other to not use their cloaking technology to try and evade these searches, Deep Space Nine was provided with advanced cloak scanning technology by them. This technology was provided in a closed system that was not open for study to Federation engineers, and Klingon or Romulan personnel have had to visit to maintain it any time it has suffered a malfunction.According to the agreement signed by the three governments, the technology is only ever used if the wormhole opens with no apparent ship transit. Further, all three governments are provided the results of all searches, including those done using the cloak scanning technology.The Federation did decide however to allow commerce and civilian traffic through the wormhole, no matter who it came from, deciding to operate Deep Space Nine as something like a freeport. Normal Federation import laws would not apply to Deep Space Nine unless the cargo was purely military in nature, or the destination for the cargo was within the Federation.The Dominion was surprised by this concession by the Federation, considering that they had surrendered unconditionally to save the Changelings from extinction. Over the last five years, commerce has slowly but surely increased, and this combined with the newfound understanding the Link obtained from Odo, has convinced the Dominion that it may actually be possible to maintain relations with some solids as equals at some point in the future.The second contact between the Federation and the Dominion came in 2377. It involved setting up a subspace link through the wormhole to enable open communication between the two powers in the future, and the construction effort for this relay was still underway, being hesitantly constructed from both sides.For the time being, the Dominion has remained within their borders and mostly silent.Little contact had been made with the Breen prior to the war, but the attack on Earth ensured that they were a prominent species in the mind of the Federation after the war ended. Their remaining ships retreated back to Breen space, ignoring all demands and efforts at contact from the Federation. Though many suggested that the Breen could simply be allowed to “go home without consequences”, no one was willing to immediately mount a campaign of aggression into Breen space.The Breen have remained conspicuously silent since the end of the war, even cutting off trade with the Ferengi, and seemingly every other species that the Federation has contact with. Starfleet Command remains very concerned about the reasons for this and about possible future conflict with the Breen, and their technology is being actively studied by Starfleet to prepare for the possibility of a conflict in the future.For the moment however, they seem to have retreated into isolation.In some ways Ferengi culture has changed radically. The impact of Rom becoming the Grand Nagus cannot be overstated, and Ferengi society has become far more equal among men and women. There has also been an emphasis from Rom on “long-term profits”, and how duplicitous business results in fewer business opportunities in the future.In other ways though, the Ferengi remain the Ferengi. While Ferengi privateers and plots remain a consistent problem for the Federation, their frequency has declined, and their scope is generally smaller. The Federation is not aware of any efforts to steal a Starfleet ship since the end of the war, although several thefts of Federation designed civilian ships have occurred.In general, the Ferengi seem to be holding up their end of agreements more frequently, and they have been the largest benefactors of the Federation policies regarding Deep Space Nine and the Gamma Quadrant following the war.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Timeline","level":2,"id":"Timeline_0"},{"heading":"The Romulans","level":2,"id":"The_Romulans_0"},{"heading":"The Klingons","level":2,"id":"The_Klingons_0"},{"heading":"The Cardassians","level":2,"id":"The_Cardassians_0"},{"heading":"The Borg","level":2,"id":"The_Borg_0"},{"heading":"The Dominion","level":2,"id":"The_Dominion_0"},{"heading":"The Breen","level":2,"id":"The_Breen_0"},{"heading":"The Ferengi","level":2,"id":"The_Ferengi_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"lore-1/the-galaxy-in-2385.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750685207017,"modifiedTime":1747747750406,"sourceSize":16502,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Lore 1/The Galaxy in 2385.md","exportPath":"lore-1/the-galaxy-in-2385.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"lore-1/the-shackleton-expanse.html":{"title":"The Shackleton Expanse","icon":"","description":"The Shackleton ExpanseFar from the heart of the Federation lies the Shackleton Expanse, a massive area of space deep within the Beta Quadrant.

Cogley argued that the Admiral had acted within her rights in the chain of command and according to Starfleet values to provide assistance to a people in need.Finally, when Lodge offered into evidence the fact that Stoker may have been telepathically manipulated through the Tilikaal artifact, the tribunal ruled to acquit Stoker of charges, but reassigned her to a position far away from the Shackleton Expanse where her condition can be monitored.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Logs","level":2,"id":"Logs_0"}],"links":["shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/order-in-court.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/summaries/season-1/hudson-log-8-court-martial.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1746419698652,"modifiedTime":1747819962025,"sourceSize":1645,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 1/Hudson Log 8 - Court Martial.md","exportPath":"sessions/summaries/season-1/hudson-log-8-court-martial.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/summaries/season-1/hudson-log-9-convention.html":{"title":"Hudson Log 9 - Convention","icon":"","description":"Stardate:: 5865.6\nMission:: <a data-href=\"Convention\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/convention.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Convention</a>\nNote:: Science Officer Kassandra Pruitt went missing while investigating some of the system survey data recovered from T'Lek.

The members of the Hudson followed several leads, including a few Orions and a Klingon thief.A human trader named Cyrano Jones was peddling a Tilikaal dagger at the convention, and caught he attention of a Romulan Sub-Commander named Thalvaek, and a couple Orions. However, Jolepo was able to buy the dagger from Jones first. This lead to a Romulan named Sarren to attempted kidnapping Jolepo, but was unsuccessful. In a gambit to find out more of the the Romulan plans and form a stronger relationship, Sukav met with subcommander Thal'vaek with an offer to sell a Tilikaal dagger.

The planet had strange cultist gazing at the black hole waiting for the day it would \"gaze back\". The black hole was rotating to annihilate the planet with its radiation jets. On the strange alien station, an away team tried to rescue Sukav.After a week of watching Sukav's tracking device linger in Romulan space, he was suddenly moved past Narendra station and into the Shackleton Expanse. The Hudson gave chase, pushing it's warp nacelles to ride over the washboard effect and catch up to the Romulan bird of prey.They found the bird of prey at a system orbiting a black hole, dubbed the Omega Draconis system. There, they found single rocky planet with no atmosphere but a series of underground structures about approximately 300 life signs. There was also a large space station made of obsidian black neutronium. The Romulans had taken Sukav, Lt Pruitt, and two Starfleet ensign s into the alien space station.As the Hudson arrived, the black hole suddenly seemed to rotate. Massive high powered radiation jets moved to expel along the galactic plane. The planet, and all ~300 people on it, stood to be annihilated. One away team went down to the planet to start an evacuation, while another went into the space station to recover Sukav and hopefully find out what caused the block hole to change orientation.The team on the planet found a small group of pale humanoids with space travel capabilities but no warp capability. They spoke about how they had spent a very long gazing into the abyss waiting for the time when the abyss would gaze back at them. They seemed unconcerned about the radiation jets.Meanwhile, a rescue team infiltrated the alien space station. Inside, they found large and humanoid-shaped automatons and a series of passageways leading into the center of the station. At the center, they found the Romulans working in a control center and the Starfleet officers tied up in the middle of the room. The rescue team ambushed the Romulans and engaged in the firefight.

On the planet, Nisha and Tak left the cultists on the service, unable to break them from their faith.On the planet, Nisha spoke to the colony's leader, Akkara and attempted to convince them to evacuate the planet. Tak quickly collected as much about this people as they could, to preserve the historical record. Although Nisha was able to provide ample evidence that the planet and everyone on it would be destroyed, Akkara's faith that the Abyss would spare them was too great. In the end, the black hole's radiation jets obliterated the planet after the Hudson's crew evacuated.Meanwhile, Verid, Sukav, Astrid, and Kyle Miller dispatched the Romulans. Astrid sustained severe disruptor burns but Sukav stabilized her. Verid and Sukav worked together to operate the station, which seemed to be controlling the black hole. The controls implied the black hole was capable of generating a wormhole, through with the black hole itself or the radiation jets would be able to annihilate anything at the coordinates. The Romulans had set the coordinates at the Klingon homeworld, Qo'Nos.Ultimately, Verid and Sukav resolved that the station had to be destroyed so that the Romulans, nor even the Federation, could return to it. Without a way to communicate with the Hudson, they stayed behind and used the controls to create a singularity inside the station itself.

When they returned to Narendra Station, they found over 100 years had passed during their time at the black hole. Several members decide to either leave Starfleet or transfer to new positions. They rest of the long lost crew of the Hudson would continue their adventures in the Shackleton Expanse.After Abyss Station was destroyed by a new singularity, the USS Hudson left the Omega Draconis system towards Narendra station. The Hudson held a vigil for the lost members of the crew, Verid and Sukav. On the way back to Narendra Station, they found the stars and systems around them had moved much further in time than anticipated, about 110 years.On the way back, the Hudson encountered a strange crystalline ship attempting to communicate through light. An away team with Robert Lodge, Jolepo, Tizia, and Nisha beamed aboard the starship. They found a crystalline species, who led them to a unidentified torpedo embedded into the crystal walls of the ship.The torpedo was still active, and the attempts to remove it went awry. Jolepo and Tizia evacuated out into space through a hole in the hull, while Robert and Nisha took cover behind a door. A large section of the starship shattered like glass, and it fled soon afterwards.The Hudson continued to Narendra station, where they found that much had changed. The alliance between the Federation had strengthened, but not without some strife. General Kargan was still in command of the station, now approaching almost 200 years old. He had limited and controlled exploration of the Shackleton Expanse over the last 100 years, fearing the fate of his old counterpart, Banna Stoker. Now, a new Admiral joined Kargan from the Federation: Admiral April Hebert.After welcoming the crew of the Hudson back to Narendra Station, April invited them to take some time off to find their new place in the world. Robert Lodge would go on to become a historian, looking into the events of the past 100 years. And Astrid Alder would take some time off to consider new options in Starfleet. In the meantime, Narendra Station would provide an interim commanding officer and supplementary crew along with a Galaxy Class starship named in the Hudson's honor.<br>\n<img alt=\"IMG-20250610-Pasted image 20250610180303}.png\" src=\"attachments/shackleton-expanse/groups/hudson/shared/sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-11.1-crystal-clear/img-20250610-pasted-image-20250610180303}.png\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Logs","level":2,"id":"Logs_0"}],"links":["shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/imminent-collision.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-11.1-crystal-clear.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":["attachments/shackleton-expanse/groups/hudson/shared/sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-11.1-crystal-clear/img-20250610-pasted-image-20250610180303}.png"],"createdTime":1748855850781,"modifiedTime":1749549791738,"sourceSize":2833,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 11.1 - Crystal Clear.md","exportPath":"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-11.1-crystal-clear.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-12-pasqual's-progress.html":{"title":"Hudson Log 12 - Pasqual's Progress","icon":"","description":"Stardate:: 56052\nMission:: <a data-href=\"Pasqual's Progress\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/missions/bottle-episodes/pasqual's-progress.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Pasqual's Progress</a>\nNote:: Captain Edward Scriba took several members of the new USS Hudson-B on a short survey mission aboard the Hudson's yacht. They visited Pasqual-1, and found the society there advancing rapidly though technological ages on their own. The people of Pasqual had embark on a century long project to go to space. An away team found a single neutronium obelisk left on the planet, which seemed to have some sort of influence on the people there.Captain Edward Scriba took several members of the USS Hudson on a survey mission aboard the captain's yacht, the USS Portland. They planned to visit Pasqual-1 on a routine survey mission, and follow that up with a visit to the Lilifas system.They found that the Pasqual-1 population had been speed-running their technological advancement. In just 110 years, they've reached the equivalent of earth's information age (already a time known for accelerated advances in technology.) After Jolepo expressed interest in visiting the planet, Captain Scriba agreed. Scriba, Jolepo, Jaro, and Delisle all went down, leaving Nisha and Tizia on the yacht.On the planet, the away team found a society with a singular focus: get into space. The people there had correctly deduced that the monoliths Starfleet removed we taken from them, and their entire culture had been driven to reach out to know what else was out there.The away team decided to find something like a library, and got directions to something the people there called repository. People there seemed to expect the away team to speak openly and constantly about what new projects and research they were working on. At the repository, the away team sought out information on the black neutronium monoliths that were removed from the planet over the last 100 years. What they found was a history of people quicky devising that someone from off world must have taken the obelisks, and that space-travel must be possible.In the repository, a weekly ideas-sharing session was held, where all in attendance were required to share their research and progress. In the middle of this atrium, a silo opened up, and one of the black monoliths rose up from below. Lieutenant Delisle felt a presence of malicious patience coming from within the silo. Jolepo scanned the area during the meeting and found a subspace signal with a some sort of sublimal messaging in it, similar to the artifact that influenced Admiral Banna Stoker 110 years ago.Jolepo presented on an energy-efficient waste-disposal system for a colony ship, which avoided any suspicion that they may be from off world. Once the meeting was over, the away team was able to find a place to be alone and beam off planet unnoticed.Before reporting back to Starfleet, the crew of the USS Portland also visited the second planet on their itinerary: Lilifas. Here, they did a survey on the pre-warp civilization below. Video footage revealed a species of centaur-like otter people with age-of-sail technology. While observing Lilifas, a tractor beam from the planet grabbed asteroid orbiting in a ring around the planet, and threw it towards the USS Portland. Lt. Nisha was able to dodge the rocks. The USS Portland then returned to Narendra station, with plans to recover the 1 monolith remaining on Pasqual-1.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Logs","level":2,"id":"Logs_0"}],"links":["shackleton-expanse/missions/bottle-episodes/pasqual's-progress.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-12-pasqual's-progress.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749459267724,"modifiedTime":1749547804265,"sourceSize":3699,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 12 - Pasqual's Progress.md","exportPath":"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-12-pasqual's-progress.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-13.1-pasqual's-past.html":{"title":"Hudson Log 13.1 - Pasqual's Past","icon":"","description":"Stardate:: 56073\nMission:: <a data-href=\"Pasqual's Past\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Pasqual's Past</a>\nNote:: Admiral Hebert gave Captain Scriba permission to make first contact with the people of Pasqual-1. There, the Pasqualese were in a frenzy trying to learn as much about Starfleet technology as possible. But in their extended visit, Jaro made a dark secret buried beneath the repository: A borg queen.Back on Narendra Station, Admiral Hebert and General Kargan met with the bridge crew of the USS Hudson to discuss what to do about the civilization on the Pasqual system. They decided, much to General Kargan's dismay, that the Federation would make first contact with the Pasqualese. Captain Scriba made this contact by connecting to the planet's global communications network and announcing the Hudson's presence and intentions of peace. The planet's activity spiked there was a frenzy of communications on the planet. But before long, the Pasquallese sent a delegation to meet with the crew of the Hudson.The delegation was amazed by Stafleet technology, particularly interested in their warp technology, transporters, and replicators. After introductions were made, Captain Scriba made arrangements to start sharing Federation technology with them as a gesture of peace.The Hudson stayed at the Pasqual system for an extended time, and the crew spent plenty of time on and around the planet communicating with an teaching the Pasqualese about what it's like to be in the Federation. Delisle in particular learned that the Pasqualese depended on their biological distinctiveness and diversity to surive, each person contributing to the whole. This led to a culture that strongly valued cooperation and sharing.Delisle also picked up aa constant feeling of anxiety from the people of Pasqual-1. As if they weren't telling the Hudson and crew everything.Meanwhile, Jaro was lead below the obelisk and met a borg queen, and told to repair the transwarp drive.

It claimed that once it found the Tilikaal, perfect beings, it could finally assimilate them to become as perfect as they are.After a great deal of debate and further investiation the Hudson's crew decided to kill the Borg queen. But the Borg queen controlled the assimilated skeletons left over in the small Borg ship and defended herself. When the last of the guard were neutralized, the Borg queen begged for it's life.

The crew managed to restore power and capture or kill the parasites. An Orion woman named Helestia was arrested for stealing scientific equipment in the confusion.The Hudson was assigned to deliver scientific equipment the small Epsilon 19 starbase at the Osarin system. The Starbase was studying a fading star, where the energy seemed to be disappearing. While aboard the station, Captain Scriba, Jolepo, and Doctor T'Lor got dinner with the station's commanding officer, Commander Johansson. At dinner, they met an Orion woman named Helestia Baenor, who had brought a number of luxuries to the station as gifts to thank the officers for allowing her crew to rest at the station. Meanwhile, the Hudson left to go study the nearby starAfter getting a tour of the station, Scriba, Jolepo, and T'Lor were aboard a turbolift with station science officer Mosa, when the station suffered a massive explosion at several points. T'Lor was able to stabilize Mosa, and they all climbed the turbolift shaft to a medical bay. There, they discovered the source of triolic radiation emanating from the engineering section, the same radiation emanating from the nearby star.In engineering, they discovered Baenor had turned off power output to the rest of the station, which had inadvertently lead to the explosion. Scriba left to pursue and arrest her. On the station's nuclear fusion reactor, Jolepo found strange energy parasite creatures out of phase in time. He used his phaser to bring them back into phase and caught several of them, but others escaped into Jefferies Tubes. By this point, power was restored to the station, and security teams could be organized to hunt down these strange creatures.

There, an away team was sent to investigate Pasqual-1, an M-class planet with a thick electromagnetic field surrounding it.The planet was inhabited by a variety of intelligent humanoid people that appear to be of many different species, but without any sort of advanced technology.

Captain Astrid Alder attempted to liaison with the Klingons, but they demanded death in combat and would not surrender. Commander Lodge and Doctor Suvok convinced the Klingon Captain to let them on board to tend to their wounded, based on giving the Klingons a fair fight.Back on the Hudson, Lt. Cmdr. Jolepo and Lt.

Their real mission was to figure out what the Klingons wanted with Admiral Stoker. The Klingon crew members seemed to be as irritated and confused about the situation as the crew of the Hudson. Their captain had kept the purpose of their mission secret, much like Admiral Stoker. However, the captain of the Klingon ship was soon forced to admit he and Stoker were after a weapon of incredible power. As the Klingon Crew mutinied, the Hudson away team left to confront Stoker.

The Hudson quickly engaged the Romulan warbird and nearly disabled it while an evacuation team attempted to get survivors off the Nightingale. In the end, a Romulan disguised as a Vulcan, named T'lek attempted to return to the bird of prey but was fired upon.

Defense Attorney Samuel T Cogley.Ahead of the trial, Jolepo and Verid investigated some of Admiral Stoker's history on the station, in particular the discharge of her son, Avery, a science officer aboard Narendra Station. They discovered that Admiral Stoker had suspected a Starfleet coverup regarding the Tilikaal and used her position to conduct a private investigation into the Subspace frequencies in the Washboard and their origin.Lodge argued through witness testimony that the Admiral had acted recklessly with her authority, and her removal from command was necessary to avoid prime directive violation and potential flashpoints leading to war with the Klingons. Cogley argued that the Admiral had acted within her rights in the chain of command and according to Starfleet values to provide assistance to a people in need.Finally, when Lodge offered into evidence the fact that Stoker may have been telepathically manipulated through the Tilikaal artifact, the tribunal ruled to acquit Stoker of charges, but reassigned her to a position far away from the Shackleton Expanse where her condition can be monitored.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 1/Hudson Log 9 - Convention.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 1/Hudson Log 9 - Convention.md\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-1/hudson-log-9-convention.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hudson Log 9 - Convention</a>: Stardate 5865.6, Session: 11Science Officer Kassandra Pruitt went missing while investigating some of the system survey data recovered from T'Lek. Since Starfleet suspected Romulan involvement, Starfleet organized a convention to lure Pruitt's abductors. The bait would be several more Starfleet officers with connections to T'Lek and Admiral Stoker from the USS Hudson.The Delegations from the Romulans, Klingons, Orions, and many Federation worlds were invited to demonstrate their scientific and technological advancements. The members of the Hudson followed several leads, including a few Orions and a Klingon thief.A human trader named Cyrano Jones was peddling a Tilikaal dagger at the convention, and caught he attention of a Romulan Sub-Commander named Thalvaek, and a couple Orions. However, Jolepo was able to buy the dagger from Jones first. This lead to a Romulan named Sarren to attempted kidnapping Jolepo, but was unsuccessful. In a gambit to find out more of the the Romulan plans and form a stronger relationship, Sukav met with subcommander Thal'vaek with an offer to sell a Tilikaal dagger. He was not seen at the convention again, but was given a tracking device that saw him brought into the Romulan Empire.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 1/Hudson Log 10.1 - Abyss Station.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 1/Hudson Log 10.1 - Abyss Station.md\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-1/hudson-log-10.1-abyss-station.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hudson Log 10.1 - Abyss Station</a>: Stardate 5899.2, Session: 12Attempting to rescue Sukav, the Hudson chased a Romulan bird of prey to a black hole with a neutronium lined space station and a singular rocky planet orbiting it. The planet had strange cultist gazing at the black hole waiting for the day it would \"gaze back\". The black hole was rotating to annihilate the planet with its radiation jets. On the strange alien station, an away team tried to rescue Sukav.After a week of watching Sukav's tracking device linger in Romulan space, he was suddenly moved past Narendra station and into the Shackleton Expanse. The Hudson gave chase, pushing it's warp nacelles to ride over the washboard effect and catch up to the Romulan bird of prey.They found the bird of prey at a system orbiting a black hole, dubbed the Omega Draconis system. There, they found single rocky planet with no atmosphere but a series of underground structures about approximately 300 life signs. There was also a large space station made of obsidian black neutronium. The Romulans had taken Sukav, Lt Pruitt, and two Starfleet ensign s into the alien space station.As the Hudson arrived, the black hole suddenly seemed to rotate. Massive high powered radiation jets moved to expel along the galactic plane. The planet, and all ~300 people on it, stood to be annihilated. One away team went down to the planet to start an evacuation, while another went into the space station to recover Sukav and hopefully find out what caused the block hole to change orientation.The team on the planet found a small group of pale humanoids with space travel capabilities but no warp capability. They spoke about how they had spent a very long gazing into the abyss waiting for the time when the abyss would gaze back at them. They seemed unconcerned about the radiation jets.Meanwhile, a rescue team infiltrated the alien space station. Inside, they found large and humanoid-shaped automatons and a series of passageways leading into the center of the station. At the center, they found the Romulans working in a control center and the Starfleet officers tied up in the middle of the room. The rescue team ambushed the Romulans and engaged in the firefight. Kyle Miller and Tizia were each wounded by disruptor fire, leaving only Verid to fend off the remaining 5 Romulans.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 1/Hudson Log 10.2 - Abyss Station Part 2.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 1/Hudson Log 10.2 - Abyss Station Part 2.md\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-1/hudson-log-10.2-abyss-station-part-2.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hudson Log 10.2 - Abyss Station Part 2</a>: Stardate 5899.2, Session: 13Verid and Sukav made the ultimate sacrifice to destroy Abyss Station, so that no one can use it again. On the planet, Nisha and Tak left the cultists on the service, unable to break them from their faith.On the planet, Nisha spoke to the colony's leader, Akkara and attempted to convince them to evacuate the planet. Tak quickly collected as much about this people as they could, to preserve the historical record. Although Nisha was able to provide ample evidence that the planet and everyone on it would be destroyed, Akkara's faith that the Abyss would spare them was too great. In the end, the black hole's radiation jets obliterated the planet after the Hudson's crew evacuated.Meanwhile, Verid, Sukav, Astrid, and Kyle Miller dispatched the Romulans. Astrid sustained severe disruptor burns but Sukav stabilized her. Verid and Sukav worked together to operate the station, which seemed to be controlling the black hole. The controls implied the black hole was capable of generating a wormhole, through with the black hole itself or the radiation jets would be able to annihilate anything at the coordinates. The Romulans had set the coordinates at the Klingon homeworld, Qo'Nos.Ultimately, Verid and Sukav resolved that the station had to be destroyed so that the Romulans, nor even the Federation, could return to it. Without a way to communicate with the Hudson, they stayed behind and used the controls to create a singularity inside the station itself. The new singularity engulphed the station, Verid, and Sukav.

When they returned to Narendra Station, they found over 100 years had passed during their time at the black hole. Several members decide to either leave Starfleet or transfer to new positions. They rest of the long lost crew of the Hudson would continue their adventures in the Shackleton Expanse.After Abyss Station was destroyed by a new singularity, the USS Hudson left the Omega Draconis system towards Narendra station. The Hudson held a vigil for the lost members of the crew, Verid and Sukav. On the way back to Narendra Station, they found the stars and systems around them had moved much further in time than anticipated, about 110 years.On the way back, the Hudson encountered a strange crystalline ship attempting to communicate through light. An away team with Robert Lodge, Jolepo, Tizia, and Nisha beamed aboard the starship. They found a crystalline species, who led them to a unidentified torpedo embedded into the crystal walls of the ship.The torpedo was still active, and the attempts to remove it went awry. Jolepo and Tizia evacuated out into space through a hole in the hull, while Robert and Nisha took cover behind a door. A large section of the starship shattered like glass, and it fled soon afterwards.The Hudson continued to Narendra station, where they found that much had changed. The alliance between the Federation had strengthened, but not without some strife. General Kargan was still in command of the station, now approaching almost 200 years old. He had limited and controlled exploration of the Shackleton Expanse over the last 100 years, fearing the fate of his old counterpart, Banna Stoker. Now, a new Admiral joined Kargan from the Federation: Admiral April Hebert.After welcoming the crew of the Hudson back to Narendra Station, April invited them to take some time off to find their new place in the world. Robert Lodge would go on to become a historian, looking into the events of the past 100 years. And Astrid Alder would take some time off to consider new options in Starfleet. In the meantime, Narendra Station would provide an interim commanding officer and supplementary crew along with a Galaxy Class starship named in the Hudson's honor.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 12 - Pasqual's Progress.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 12 - Pasqual's Progress.md\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-12-pasqual's-progress.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hudson Log 12 - Pasqual's Progress</a>: Stardate 56052, Session: 15Captain Edward Scriba took several members of the new USS Hudson-B on a short survey mission aboard the Hudson's yacht. They visited Pasqual-1, and found the society there advancing rapidly though technological ages on their own. The people of Pasqual had embark on a century long project to go to space. An away team found a single neutronium obelisk left on the planet, which seemed to have some sort of influence on the people there.Captain Edward Scriba took several members of the USS Hudson on a survey mission aboard the captain's yacht, the USS Portland. They planned to visit Pasqual-1 on a routine survey mission, and follow that up with a visit to the Lilifas system.They found that the Pasqual-1 population had been speed-running their technological advancement. In just 110 years, they've reached the equivalent of earth's information age (already a time known for accelerated advances in technology.) After Jolepo expressed interest in visiting the planet, Captain Scriba agreed. Scriba, Jolepo, Jaro, and Delisle all went down, leaving Nisha and Tizia on the yacht.On the planet, the away team found a society with a singular focus: get into space. The people there had correctly deduced that the monoliths Starfleet removed we taken from them, and their entire culture had been driven to reach out to know what else was out there.The away team decided to find something like a library, and got directions to something the people there called repository. People there seemed to expect the away team to speak openly and constantly about what new projects and research they were working on. At the repository, the away team sought out information on the black neutronium monoliths that were removed from the planet over the last 100 years. What they found was a history of people quicky devising that someone from off world must have taken the obelisks, and that space-travel must be possible.In the repository, a weekly ideas-sharing session was held, where all in attendance were required to share their research and progress. In the middle of this atrium, a silo opened up, and one of the black monoliths rose up from below. Lieutenant Delisle felt a presence of malicious patience coming from within the silo. Jolepo scanned the area during the meeting and found a subspace signal with a some sort of sublimal messaging in it, similar to the artifact that influenced Admiral Banna Stoker 110 years ago.Jolepo presented on an energy-efficient waste-disposal system for a colony ship, which avoided any suspicion that they may be from off world. Once the meeting was over, the away team was able to find a place to be alone and beam off planet unnoticed.Before reporting back to Starfleet, the crew of the USS Portland also visited the second planet on their itinerary: Lilifas. Here, they did a survey on the pre-warp civilization below. Video footage revealed a species of centaur-like otter people with age-of-sail technology. While observing Lilifas, a tractor beam from the planet grabbed asteroid orbiting in a ring around the planet, and threw it towards the USS Portland. Lt. Nisha was able to dodge the rocks. The USS Portland then returned to Narendra station, with plans to recover the 1 monolith remaining on Pasqual-1.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 13.1 - Pasqual's Past.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 13.1 - Pasqual's Past.md\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-13.1-pasqual's-past.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hudson Log 13.1 - Pasqual's Past</a>: Stardate 56073, Session: 16Admiral Hebert gave Captain Scriba permission to make first contact with the people of Pasqual-1. There, the Pasqualese were in a frenzy trying to learn as much about Starfleet technology as possible. But in their extended visit, Jaro made a dark secret buried beneath the repository: A borg queen.Back on Narendra Station, Admiral Hebert and General Kargan met with the bridge crew of the USS Hudson to discuss what to do about the civilization on the Pasqual system. They decided, much to General Kargan's dismay, that the Federation would make first contact with the Pasqualese. Captain Scriba made this contact by connecting to the planet's global communications network and announcing the Hudson's presence and intentions of peace. The planet's activity spiked there was a frenzy of communications on the planet. But before long, the Pasquallese sent a delegation to meet with the crew of the Hudson.The delegation was amazed by Stafleet technology, particularly interested in their warp technology, transporters, and replicators. After introductions were made, Captain Scriba made arrangements to start sharing Federation technology with them as a gesture of peace.The Hudson stayed at the Pasqual system for an extended time, and the crew spent plenty of time on and around the planet communicating with an teaching the Pasqualese about what it's like to be in the Federation. Delisle in particular learned that the Pasqualese depended on their biological distinctiveness and diversity to surive, each person contributing to the whole. This led to a culture that strongly valued cooperation and sharing.Delisle also picked up aa constant feeling of anxiety from the people of Pasqual-1. As if they weren't telling the Hudson and crew everything.Meanwhile, Jaro was lead below the obelisk and met a borg queen, and told to repair the transwarp drive. There, he came face to face with some sort of Borg head in a jar. It awoke and said, \"Greetings.\"\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 13.2 - The Proto-Borg.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 13.2 - The Proto-Borg.md\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-13.2-the-proto-borg.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hudson Log 13.2 - The Proto-Borg</a>: Stardate 56091, Session: 17The crew of the Hudson learned that the org believed itself to be a creation of the Tilikaal. Thinking the Borg was too much of a threat, the crew killed the \"Borg queen\" and calledi n the Federation, who occupied the planet briefly to remove all possible borg and Tilikaal influence on the planet.Below the repository, Jaro spoke with the Borg, learning that it had arrived thousands of years ago and was forced to remain dormant while the planet's electromagnetic field was active. But in the past 100 years, it had awoken and was using the Tilikaal monolith to influence and guide to people of Pasqual-1.The Borg \"Queen\" talked about being a creation of the Tilikaal, and that its mission was to travel the stars in search of them. It claimed that once it found the Tilikaal, perfect beings, it could finally assimilate them to become as perfect as they are.After a great deal of debate and further investiation the Hudson's crew decided to kill the Borg queen. But the Borg queen controlled the assimilated skeletons left over in the small Borg ship and defended herself. When the last of the guard were neutralized, the Borg queen begged for it's life. But Jolepo executed it.Starfleet and a compliment of Klingon battleships arrived on Pasqual and occupied it. There was a full sweep of the planet and find and root out and Borg technology. It took weeks. The Tilikaal monolith was excavated and removed from the planet also.While the people of Pasqual-1 now had a great leap in technology, they were left with a disdain for the Federation.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 14 - The Qofuari Conundrum.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 14 - The Qofuari Conundrum.md\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-14-the-qofuari-conundrum.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hudson Log 14 - The Qofuari Conundrum</a>: Stardate 56107, Session: 18The Hudson responded to a distress call from a population of futurists on a planet where advanced technology was illegal to develop. After deliberating over the demands of the Prime Directive, the Hudson took many of the futurists aboard to bring back to Narendra Station.The Hudson responded to a distress call from a Pre-Warp at the Lilifas system. They got in touch with a group of local Qofuari calling themselves the Future Builders. They claimed they were being held captive on their planet because development of advanced technology was illegal, despite their ability to do so.The Hudson got in touch with the planet's local authorities and spent time learning about the Qofuari and their culture. They were a fairly tribal people, but had managed to enforce this law globally due to matching cultural values. The Qofuari had also been evolved from Tilikaal monoliths similar to the Pasqualese, but at some point had managed to disassemble the monoliths themselves. The existence of the monoliths seemed to have been impetus for the laws against technology in the first placeIn the end, the Hudson agreed to take aboard the Future builders and bring them back to Narendra Station, taking them away from their home planet.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 15 - Fading Sun.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 15 - Fading Sun.md\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-15-fading-sun.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hudson Log 15 - Fading Sun</a>: Stardate 56127, Session: 19The Hudson visited the starbase Epsilon 19, where energy parasites from a nearby star had caused several major explosions. The crew managed to restore power and capture or kill the parasites. An Orion woman named Helestia was arrested for stealing scientific equipment in the confusion.The Hudson was assigned to deliver scientific equipment the small Epsilon 19 starbase at the Osarin system. The Starbase was studying a fading star, where the energy seemed to be disappearing. While aboard the station, Captain Scriba, Jolepo, and Doctor T'Lor got dinner with the station's commanding officer, Commander Johansson. At dinner, they met an Orion woman named Helestia Baenor, who had brought a number of luxuries to the station as gifts to thank the officers for allowing her crew to rest at the station. Meanwhile, the Hudson left to go study the nearby starAfter getting a tour of the station, Scriba, Jolepo, and T'Lor were aboard a turbolift with station science officer Mosa, when the station suffered a massive explosion at several points. T'Lor was able to stabilize Mosa, and they all climbed the turbolift shaft to a medical bay. There, they discovered the source of triolic radiation emanating from the engineering section, the same radiation emanating from the nearby star.In engineering, they discovered Baenor had turned off power output to the rest of the station, which had inadvertently lead to the explosion. Scriba left to pursue and arrest her. On the station's nuclear fusion reactor, Jolepo found strange energy parasite creatures out of phase in time. He used his phaser to bring them back into phase and caught several of them, but others escaped into Jefferies Tubes. By this point, power was restored to the station, and security teams could be organized to hunt down these strange creatures. The station would later be given better shielding to prevent infection from the local start, where the Hudson had discovered the parasites breeding.Helestia Baenor was arrested and found with Starfleet science equipment aboard her ship. She claimed to be attempting to rescue the equipment and prevent it from becoming damaged in the exploding starbase. She would be brought to Narendra Station for trial.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 16.1 - Convoy SE-119.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 16.1 - Convoy SE-119.md\" href=\"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-16.1-convoy-se-119.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hudson Log 16.1 - Convoy SE-119</a>: Stardate 56168, Session: 20The Hudson and Klingon ship Mupwl' escorted a convoy to a new colony location in the Shackleton Expanse. Along the way, the Mupwl' was disabled by subspace eddies and the convoy atted by pirated calling themselves \"Vinshari\"Both the Mupwl' and Hudson were in Narendra station undergoing minor refits, repairs, and maintenance. Akarra asked captain to help convince Kargan to approve a colonization effort in the Shackleton expanse. The Hudson would provide cover for the convpy along with Akkara's IKS Mupwl'. Kargan reluctantly agreed.Along the way, the convoy headed through a region of the Expanse with strange subspace eddies in the washboard. Unlike the usual background turbulence of the washboard subspace waves.In these eddies, the Mupwl' suffered a sudden explosion in one of their warp nacelles, and comms were disrupted by the eddies as well. While the Hudson tried to make contact and organize repair teams, two unidentified ships with sails and masts appeared on the sensors, seemingly being \"behind\" the subspace eddies.The unidentified ships demanded the Hudson and Mupwl' had over their warp cores because \"Power is our right.\" and attacked soon after. On the viewscreen, the enemies identified themselves as Vinshari and had bright red skin, with collar bones that rose out of the skin and flanked their necks like cape collars.The Hudson positioned itself to protect the convoy ships, and the Vinshari ships deployed a dozen small single fighters. Commander Jaro as able to modulate the Hudson's shields to crush half the fighters in a subspace eddy, which also collapsed the eddy itself.One of the larger Vinshari ships attacked the disabled Mupwl' and another tried to deal with the Hudson, while the remaining small fighters maneuvered to intercept the freighters. The Vinshari ships had difficulty piercing the Hudson's shields with their physical ammunition. And have since maneuvered around them to focus on the freighters. The Hudson is equipped with dozens of shuttles.
