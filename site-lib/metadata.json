In just 110 years, they've reached the equivalent of earth's information age (already a time known for accelerated advances in technology.) After Jolepo expressed interest in visiting the planet, Captain Scriba agreed. Scriba, Jolepo, Jaro, and Delisle all went down, leaving Nisha and Tizia on the yacht.On the planet, the away team found a society with a singular focus: get into space. The people there had correctly deduced that the monoliths Starfleet removed we taken from them, and their entire culture had been driven to reach out to know what else was out there.The away team decided to find something like a library, and got directions to something the people there called repository. People there seemed to expect the away team to speak openly and constantly about what new projects and research they were working on. At the repository, the away team sought out information on the black neutronium monoliths that were removed from the planet over the last 100 years. What they found was a history of people quicky devising that someone from off world must have taken the obelisks, and that space-travel must be possible.In the repository, a weekly ideas-sharing session was held, where all in attendance were required to share their research and progress. In the middle of this atrium, a silo opened up, and one of the black monoliths rose up from below. Lieutenant Delisle felt a presence of malicious patience coming from within the silo. Jolepo scanned the area during the meeting and found a subspace signal with a some sort of sublimal messaging in it, similar to the artifact that influenced Admiral Banna Stoker 110 years ago.Jolepo presented on an energy-efficient waste-disposal system for a colony ship, which avoided any suspicion that they may be from off world. Once the meeting was over, the away team was able to find a place to be alone and beam off planet unnoticed.Before reporting back to Starfleet, the crew of the USS Portland also visited the second planet on their itinerary: Lilifas. Here, they did a survey on the pre-warp civilization below. Video footage revealed a species of centaur-like otter people with age-of-sail technology. While observing Lilifas, a tractor beam from the planet grabbed asteroid orbiting in a ring around the planet, and threw it towards the USS Portland. Lt. Nisha was able to dodge the rocks. The USS Portland then returned to Narendra station, with plans to recover the 1 monolith remaining on Pasqual-1.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-12-pasqual's-progress.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1757603434274,"modifiedTime":1759218174556,"sourceSize":4055,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 12 - Pasqual's Progress.md","exportPath":"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-12-pasqual's-progress.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":44,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-13.1-pasqual's-past.html":{"title":"Hudson Log 13.1 - Pasqual's Past","icon":"","description":"Back on Narendra Station, Admiral Hebert and General Kargan met with the bridge crew of the USS Hudson to discuss what to do about the civilization on the Pasqual system.

They decided not to go further into the cave, and returned to the Aqua Shuttle to boost their communications to the Hudson. Transport was still impossible due to interference.A submersible shuttle found them, piloted by a woman named Noralith, who looked much like a Vulcan or a Romulan. She claimed escape was impossible but offered to bring them to a sanctuary. Inside a massive underwater dome, the crew discovered an ancient city of ruins sustained by a large crystal. The crystal projected a beam that created a force field dome that kept the ocean at bay. No one fully understood the crystal’s operation, but disturbing it could collapse the dome entirely.The city housed survivors from multiple species, including Vinshari, Qofuari, and Noralith’s own people, the Akaru.

Delisle convinced the Vinshari \"engineers\" that the Hudson's team could take care of the Ha'kiv and made room for it in a shuttlebay.Both USS Hudson sections worked to re-establish contact by tracking warp trails, triangulating their positions amongst the stars, pinging each other with comms signals.Once reunited, Captain Scriba met with J'lara and the Thaccin. J'lara, devastated by the destruction of her people, agreed to return to Narendra Station. Thaccin engaged in silent telepathic communication with Delisle but refused to share anything about their own species. When Scriba asked again for a DNA sample, Thaccin declined.

Thaccin reported an uncanny sense of belonging, suggesting the planet might be their species’ lost homeworld. Noralith, while unfamiliar with the ruins, recognized the Akaru design and flagged the group as likely religious extremists.The away team had Scriba, Tak, Jaro, Franklin, Delisle, and Jalipo with a security detachment. They beamed into an urban landscape with pentagonal buildings and glowing conduits beneath the streets. These power lines pulsed with energy, all flowing toward the distant pyramid.Immediately, both Delisle and Thaccin began hearing psychic cries: “Help. They’re hurting us. Let us go.” Thaccin, overwhelmed by grief, asked to be transported back to the Hudson, which Scriba approved.Following the energy lines, the team approached the pyramid and observed the Akaru speaking with the strange alien, who telepathically introduced itself as Assessor Tredik. “Welcome. I was not expecting other visitors. May you be more congenial than these.” The Akaru didn’t seem to notice the Starfleet team.However, when a group of Akaru researchers rounded the corner, the team tried to hide. Half managed to dive into a nearby building, which sealed shut behind them, leaving Scriba and Tak behind. The two were captured, interrogated by the Akaru leader (who asked only “What use are you?”), and when Scriba had no answers they liked, they were both locked in the brig of the Akaru ship to be “processed.”Inside the sealed building, Jaro, Jalipo, and Delisle discovered an art gallery filled with sculptures, paintings, and reliefs of various species. Each piece credited its “creator.” One name stood out: Ash-Tamalia, listed as the creator of the Cal-Mirrans.Following the gallery, the team snuck to the ship’s cargo ramp, boarded unseen, and assaulted the brig guards. One guard triggered an alarm before being subdued, prompting a wave of Akaru reinforcements to return to the ship. The Starfleet team fought through the ship’s interior and reached the bridge, but just before they could seize control, the Akaru leader used captain’s override codes to lock the system down.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-22-candidate-three.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1759744713869,"modifiedTime":1759746080578,"sourceSize":3462,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hudson/Shared/Sessions/Summaries/Season 2/Hudson Log 22 - Candidate Three.md","exportPath":"sessions/summaries/season-2/hudson-log-22-candidate-three.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":59,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"uss-hudson-b.html":{"title":"USS Hudson-B","icon":"","description":"Summary\nLocation:: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Locations/Shackleton Expanse/The Shackleton Expanse\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Locations/Shackleton Expanse/The Shackleton Expanse\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/locations/shackleton-expanse/the-shackleton-expanse.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Shackleton Expanse</a><br>\nPortrait:: <img alt=\"IMG-20250610-Hudson B Portrait}.png\" src=\"attachments/shackleton-expanse/groups/hudson/shared/uss-hudson-b/img-20250610-hudson-b-portrait}.png\" target=\"_self\">\nNote:: The NCC-7832-B: A exploration and diplomatic exchange ship set to explore the Shackleton Expanse.\n<br>A <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"The Federation\" data-href=\"The Federation\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/lore/factions/the-federation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Federation</a> Galaxy Class starship commanded by <a data-href=\"Edward Scriba\" href=\"crew/edward-scriba.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Edward Scriba</a>.
