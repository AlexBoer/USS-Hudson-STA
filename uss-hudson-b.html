The subspace waves prevent long range communication and warp travel. They were found to be originated on Bacchus-3. An away team was put together to investigate the planet and hopefully deactivate whatever is causing the waves. On the planet, several Federation members were found, studying massive monoliths reaching into the upper atmosphere. The Hudson's away team was able to open a door on the monolith, revealing passageways inside.

But in the past 100 years, it had awoken and was using the Tilikaal monolith to influence and guide to people of Pasqual-1.<br><br>The Borg "Queen" talked about being a creation of the Tilikaal, and that its mission was to travel the stars in search of them. It claimed that once it found the Tilikaal, perfect beings, it could finally assimilate them to become as perfect as they are.<br><br>After a great deal of debate and further investiation the Hudson's crew decided to kill the Borg queen. But the Borg queen controlled the assimilated skeletons left over in the small Borg ship and defended herself. When the last of the guard were neutralized, the Borg queen begged for it's life. But Jolepo executed it.<br><br>Starfleet and a compliment of Klingon battleships arrived on Pasqual and occupied it. There was a full sweep of the planet and find and root out and Borg technology. It took weeks. The Tilikaal monolith was excavated and removed from the planet also.<br><br>While the people of Pasqual-1 now had a great leap in technology, they were left with a disdain for the Federation.</details>

They claimed they were being held captive on their planet because development of advanced technology was illegal, despite their ability to do so.<br><br>The Hudson got in touch with the planet's local authorities and spent time learning about the Qofuari and their culture. They were a fairly tribal people, but had managed to enforce this law globally due to matching cultural values.

The Starbase was studying a fading star, where the energy seemed to be disappearing. While aboard the station, Captain Scriba, Jolepo, and Doctor T'Lor got dinner with the station's commanding officer, Commander Johansson.

Scriba left to pursue and arrest her. On the station's nuclear fusion reactor, Jolepo found strange energy parasite creatures out of phase in time. He used his phaser to bring them back into phase and caught several of them, but others escaped into Jefferies Tubes. By this point, power was restored to the station, and security teams could be organized to hunt down these strange creatures. The station would later be given better shielding to prevent infection from the local start, where the Hudson had discovered the parasites breeding.<br><br>Helestia Baenor was arrested and found with Starfleet science equipment aboard her ship.
